# FaceRecognition

This is the frontend of my FaceRecognition web application made using React.js, Node.js+Express.js, HTML, CSS, etc.
The app uses a Machine Learning API to detect faces on images. Just go and paste the address of any image on the text box and press 'Detect'. You will get a box surrounding the face on the image.
The application can be found live at https://faceecognition-aviralverma.herokuapp.com
