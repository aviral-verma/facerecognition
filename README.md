# FaceRecognition

This is the frontend of my FaceRecognition web application made using React.js, Node.js+Express.js, HTML, CSS, etc.

The app uses a Machine Learning API to detect faces on images. Once you register into the application, just paste the address of any image on the text box and press 'Detect'. You will get a box surrounding the face on the image. The app also keeps a count of the number of images you detected.

The backend can be found at https://github.com/aviral-verma/facerecognition-api

The application can be found live at https://faceecognition-aviralverma.herokuapp.com
